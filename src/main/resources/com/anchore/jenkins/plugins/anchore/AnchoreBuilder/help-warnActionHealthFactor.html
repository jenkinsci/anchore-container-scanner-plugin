<div>
    The amplification factor to apply to warn actions when computing the build health score.
    <br />
    The default factor is <code>5.0</code>
    <ul>
        <li>A factor of <code>0.0</code> means that warn actions will not influence the build health score.</li>
        <li>A factor of <code>0.1</code> means that 10 warn actions result in 99% health</li>
        <li>A factor of <code>0.5</code> means that 10 warn actions result in 95% health</li>
        <li>A factor of <code>1.0</code> means that 10 warn actions result in 90% health</li>
        <li>A factor of <code>2.0</code> means that 10 warn actions result in 80% health</li>
        <li>A factor of <code>2.5</code> means that 10 warn actions result in 75% health</li>
        <li>A factor of <code>5.0</code> means that 10 warn actions result in 50% health</li>
        <li>A factor of <code>10.0</code> means that 10 warn actions result in 0% health</li>
        <li>A factor of <code>25.0</code> means that 1 warn action results in 75% health</li>
    </ul>
    The factor is persisted with the build results, so changes will only be reflected in new builds.
